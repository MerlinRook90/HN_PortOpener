The files here are mostly xml documents that are meant to be read by the game Hacknet.
They probably won't be very useful to you unless you own the game.

The game is based on gaining access to computers using hacking tools that exploit the services running on certain ports.
The game's "level editor" (if you could even call it that) does not support adding new hacking tools to the game.
This project's goal is to explore alternate methods of opening ports that can be controlled by the player.
