    <body>Howdy.

I hear that you are a reasonably skilled hacker. I need your help with a project of mine.

I've discovered a security vulnerability which would allow me to be able to compromise all ports running the Blizzard Updater service. If you help me out, I will use it whenever you need.

My problem is that I require a valid passkey in order to access the target machine. Each computer with a port running the service should have a passkey associated with it. Here's a list of a few such computers that I've gathered. Find one that you can hack into, then get the passkey and send it to me along with the site id.
