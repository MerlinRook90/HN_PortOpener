    <body>Thanks!
It should only take me a moment to set everything up. I'll contact you when it's ready.
This is only my first real project, so I'm a little bit nervous...
I mean, I'm sure it will work, but this kind of stuff isn't so easily testable in artificial conditions.
There might be a part of my theories where I'm wrong, and I'll have to fix it.
I'm just rambling now; you don't need to hear this. I'll be done in a jiffy.
