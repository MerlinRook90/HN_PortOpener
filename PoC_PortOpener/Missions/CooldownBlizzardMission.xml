    <body>Alright.

The ports should be open for the next two minutes.

What I'm using to open the ports is basically a slightly modified version of Blizzard's auto-updater, so hopefully nobody will notice anything amiss.

I'll be sending you updates about the progress. One thing I should probably mention... Once the updates are finished all of the machines will reset and you won't be able to access them for a while. If I'm correct, that should be enough time for the ports to reset if they have a half-decent autoadmin, so get your business done quick.

Good luck with whatever you're doing this time.
